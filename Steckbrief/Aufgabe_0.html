            HTML vs. Time by Lorenzo Geyer
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Does it make sense to create a website in HTML with code?
        </h2>
        <p>This is the first question I want to answer using this great website and, sometimes, gifs. It is of upmost importancy because<br>
            the web is shifting. Shifting from using code editors like "Visual Studio Code" to using page builder like "Elementor" or "Webflow".<br><br>
            Ugh, these suck, everything sucks. Let us start with a poem.
        </p>
        <h3><center><i>"My Bonnie lies over the ocean.<br>
        My Bonnie lies over the sea.<br>
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.<br>
        Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me."</i></center></h3>


        <br></br>
        <h3>Following the conclusions from above the answer clearly is...</h3>
        <h2>Yes!</h2>
        <p>And this way it should be. For now and all eternity. Amen. Praise the Lord. <i>End of conclusion</i></p>
